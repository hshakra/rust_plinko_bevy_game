# Satisfying Plinko Game

Even though I don’t gamble and never will, I came across a game mechanic that felt surprisingly satisfying. I couldn’t find a version that was smooth and responsive, so I decided to build my own implementation in Rust using Bevy, focusing on performance and feel.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive ball physics
- Built with Rust and the Bevy game engine
- Focused on satisfying visual and tactile feedback
- Lightweight and easy to run

## Controls

- **Space** — Drop a ball
- **W** — Spam drop balls
- **R** — Reset balance to $3,000

## Build & Run

Make sure you have Rust installed. Then run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
